# Manifest

This repository exists as a governance and constraint archive.

It is not:
- a startup repository
- a framework seeking adoption
- a governance authority
- a policy mandate
- a belief system
- a roadmap

No claims of inevitability, supremacy, or enforcement are made.

The work intentionally prioritizes restraint, refusal, and
non-dominance over capability expansion.
