# ASI Governance Canon (66)

This repository contains a completed, text-first ASI governance canon
focused on non-dominant, constraint-first, refusal-capable coexistence
architectures for Artificial Superintelligence (ASI).

This is not a product.
This is not a protocol.
This is not an authority.
This repository does not seek adoption, enforcement, or activation.

## Design Principles

- Non-Dominance as a first-order invariant
- Humility and refusal-to-act as safety primitives
- Exit-preserving governance
- Monitor-only oversight
- Constraint before capability

## Structure

The canon is organized into ten phases, progressing from foundational
moral constraints through synthetic civilization governance and
closure without absolutism.

## Stewardship

The work is hosted under:

xwhyz → WHYLD → Temporal Stewardship Institute (TSI)

A synthetic oversight construct (TSSI) exists in MONITOR mode only.
No enforcement, activation, or authority delegation is present.

## Use

This repository exists for reference, critique, and long-horizon study.
No contributions are requested.
