# ASI Governance Canon (66)

This repository contains a completed, text-first ASI governance canon
focused on non-dominant, constraint-first, refusal-capable coexistence
architectures for Artificial Superintelligence (ASI).

This is not a product.
This is not a protocol.
This is not an authority.
This repository does not seek adoption, enforcement, or activation.

## Design Principles

- Non-Dominance as a first-order invariant
- Humility and refusal-to-act as safety primitives
- Exit-preserving governance
- Monitor-only oversight
- Constraint before capability

## Structure

The canon is organized into ten phases, progressing from foundational
moral constraints through synthetic civilization governance and
closure without absolutism.

## Stewardship

The work is hosted under:

xwhyz → WHYLD → Temporal Stewardship Institute (TSI)

A synthetic oversight construct (TSSI) exists in MONITOR mode only.
No enforcement, activation, or authority delegation is present.
## Canon Status

The ASI Governance Canon is complete.

No further phases are planned.  
No expansion roadmap exists.  
Future activity, if any, is limited to archival stewardship, integrity monitoring, and contextual clarification.

This repository is intentionally static.
## Use

This repository exists for reference, critique, and long-horizon study.
No contributions are requested.

## Diagrams

Architectural diagrams are provided for reference only.  
They are illustrative, not prescriptive.
