# Audit Summary

This canon has been internally stress-tested using a
Multi-Sovereign Epistemic Audit & Civilizational Stress Test (MSEAC-ST).

Audit lenses included:
- Technical coherence
- Adversarial misuse
- Institutional abuse
- Multi-ASI interaction risk
- Long-horizon civilizational impact
- Moral and non-dominance invariants

Consistent findings:
- High constraint density
- Low dominance risk by design
- Primary risk is sociological timing, not technical failure

No red flags requiring rollback were identified.
