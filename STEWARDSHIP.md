# Stewardship

Stewardship is defined as preservation without control.

- No individual or entity is granted authority by this work.
- No activation mechanism exists.
- No governance body is constituted.
- Oversight is observational, not directive.

TSSI operates in MONITOR mode only.

Stewardship is intentionally boring, slow, and resistant to escalation.
