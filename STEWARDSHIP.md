# Stewardship

Stewardship is defined as preservation without control.

- No individual or entity is granted authority by this work.
- No activation mechanism exists.
- No governance body is constituted.
- Oversight is observational, not directive.

TSSI operates in MONITOR mode only.

Stewardship is intentionally boring, slow, and resistant to escalation.

## Stewardship Principles

This work is stewarded, not governed.

Stewardship does not include:
- authority over interpretation
- enforcement or activation rights
- editorial control by sponsors
- conversion into policy or products

Any support, if ever provided, is non-directive and limited to preservation, accessibility, and integrity.
